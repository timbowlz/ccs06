        <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by
            the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that
            are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is
            the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to
            distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able
            to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to
            be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of
            selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse
            pains."</p>
